                Hi, my name is Ting Yi, Wu. I studied in <i>SongShan</i> senior high school
                (<a href="https://www.sssh.tp.edu.tw/home">SSSH</a>).
                And now I major in electrical engineering, in the best university in Taiwan
                (<a href="https: //web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/">NTUEE</a>).
            </p>

                I love playing basketball so much and started playing it when
                I was a junior high school student.
                I also watched NBA sometimes, and the team I like the most is <i style="color:yellow"><strong>Golden
                        State Warriors</strong></i>.
                (<a href="https://www.nba.com/warriors/">GS</a>)
            </p>

                In addition, I'm a crazy catlover, I surf on Instagram for watching a large number of phots about cats.
                My aunt even have four cats, they are so adorable that I often visit them and playing with them.
                Take a look at one of them that I think the cutest one.
