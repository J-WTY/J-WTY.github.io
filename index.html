            Hi, my name is Ting Yi, Wu. I studied in <i>SongShan</i> senior high school
            (<a href="https://www.sssh.tp.edu.tw/home">SSSH</a>).
            <br>
            And now I major in electrical engineering, in the best university in Taiwan
            (<a href="https: //web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/">NTUEE</a>).

            I love playing basketball so much and started playing it when
            I was a junior high school student.
            I also watched NBA sometimes, and the team I like the most is <i><strong>Golden State Warriors</strong></i>.
            (<a href="https://www.nba.com/warriors/">GS</a>)

            In addition, I'm a crazy catlover, I surf on Instagram for watching a large number of phots about cats.
            My aunt even have four cats, they are so adorable that I often visit them and playing with them.
            Take a look at one of them that I think the cutest one.
