                Hi, my name is Ting Yi, Wu. I studied in <i>SongShan</i> senior high school
                (<a href="https://www.sssh.tp.edu.tw/home">SSSH</a>).
                And now I major in electrical engineering, in the best university in Taiwan
                (<a href="https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/">NTUEE</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                In the following hobbies are something more about me:
                <br>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>I love playing basketball so much and started playing it when
                    I was just a junior high school student.
                    I also watched NBA sometimes, and the team I like the most is <i style="color:yellow"><strong>Golden
                            State Warriors</strong></i>
                    (<a href="https://www.nba.com/warriors/">GS</a>).
                    I believe that they'll be the NBA champion this year!
                <li>I have worked out for several years since I was in the senior high school.
                    In the beginning, I watched some videos on Youtube to learn how to start working out, and one of my
                    favorite channel is "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FittingRoomTW">Fitting Room TW</a>". With
                    their videos, I got to improve a lot in a short time, learning the correct training ways and
                    concepts.
                <li>I also like playing guitar, but I just started learning recently and I still a rookie. I watch some
                    teaching videos on Youtube to learn how to play, and the channel that I watch the most is
                    "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%E8%80%81%E5%BE%90%E5%BD%88%E5%90%89%E4%BB%96">老徐彈吉他</a>".
                    Although in this semester I have less time to play guitar, but it is still one of ways for me to
                    relax and relieve stress.
            </ol>

                In addition, I'm a crazy catlover, I surf on Instagram for watching a large number of phots about cats.
                My aunt even have four cats, they are so adorable that I often visit them and playing with them.
                Take a look at one of them that I think the cutest one.
